  * https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Wayshrine/
* TargetPortal by Smoothbrain
<img src="https://wackymole.com/hosts/TargetPortalIcon.png" width="600"/> 

  * https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/TargetPortal/
  * This a recommended mod, has good Compatibility 
* and most of the other mods.

## Author's Note:
* Mod was produced with the hope that multiplayer servers will require more teamwork or more PVP to capture the scarce resource.
* Other mods can allow the resources to be bought at the trader for high prices, gambled on or become rare drops from bosses.
* If you are using *ServerCharacters*,
  * It is suggested to set the starting quantity amount to 0 for dedicated server and let ServerCharacters mod handle the first time spawn in amounts.
